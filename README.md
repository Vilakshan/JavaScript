Numbers

JS doesn't make a distinction between Integer and Floating-point values.
i.e. 1 and 1.0 are same numbers.
In JS all numbers are represented as floating-point values.
JS represents numbers using the 64-bit floating-point format.
Numeric literal
when a number appears directly in a JS program, it’s called a numeric literal.
Numeric literals can be preceded by a minus sign (-) to make the number negative. Technically, however, - is the unary negation operator and is not a part of the numeric literal.
Floating-point literals
2.36
	2563.4896
		JS Also supports Exponential notation
		6.02e23	// 6.02 * 1023	(base-10)
		6.02e-23	// 6.02 * 10-23	(base-10)
Integer literals
Base-10 integers
	9
	0
	897

Base-16 Hexadecimal values
			0xff	// 15*16 + 15 = 255 (base-10)
			0XCAfe546

Base-8 octal format
			0377	// 3*64 + 7*8 + 7 = 255 (base-10)
			Avoid using octal literal with leading 0, as all implementations of JS do not support octal literals. In ES5 strict mode, octal literals are explicitly forbidden.

Arithmetic in JS

Basic arithmetic operators
+ for addition
- for subtraction
* for multiplication
/ for division
% for modulo (remainder after division)

Complex arithmetic operations
	For complex operations JS provides a Math object which provides various methods to perform complex mathematical operations.

Overflow
It occurs when the result of a numeric operation is larger than the largest representable number.
The result is special infinity value, which JS prints as ‘Infinity’
For a negative number larger than the largest representable negative number JS prints ‘-Infinity’.
Infinity ( + or - or * or / or % ) any number = Infinity

Underflow
It occurs when the result of a numeric operation is closer to 0 than the smallest representable number.
In case of underflow JS returns 0
In case of underflow occurred from negative a number JS returns a special value ‘-0’ known as negative zero

Any number divided by 0 is not an error in JS, JS returns Infinity or -Infinity
In JS 0/0 evaluates to a special value NaN (not a number).
Infinity/Infinity => NaN
JS defines Infinity and NaN  as global variables.
In ES3 Infinity and NaN were read/write values but ES5 corrects it and made them read-only.

ToDo: Binary Floating-Point and Rounding Errors




Text

In JS a string is an immutable ordered sequence of 16-bit values, each of which typically represents a Unicode character.
Strings are JS type for representing text.
JS strings use zero-based indexing.


Boolean Values

A boolean value represents truth or falsehood, on or off, yes or no. there are only two possible values.
JS has two reserved keywords for boolean values, these are ‘true’ and ‘false’.


Null and Undefined


Null is a language keyword.
Null has a special value which indicates absence of a value.
Undefined is a predefined global variable (not a language keyword).
Undefined also indicates absence of value but in a deeper sense than Null.
Querying a variable, which is declared but not assigned with any value, returns ‘undefined’.
Querying value of a object-property or array-element which does not exist returns ‘undefined’.
Null == undefined evaluates to true indicating that both indicates absence of value.
Null === undefined evaluates to false indicating that both are of different type.
Null and undefined, both are falsy values.
Null and undefined, both have no properties or method, use of . or [] operator gives ‘TypeError’.
Undefined should be used to represent system-level, unexpected or error-like absence of value.
Null should be used to represent program-level, normal or expected absence of value.
If programmer needs to ( intentionally ) assign one of these values to a variable or property or pass one of these values to a function, Null is the right choice.

The Global Object

When the JS interpreter starts (or whenever a web browser loads a new page), it creates a new global object and gives it an initial set of properties that define
Global properties like undefined, Infinity and NaN
Global functions like isNaN(), parseInt() and eval()
Constructor functions like Date(), RegExp(), String(), Object() and Array()
Global objects like Math and JSON

In client side JavaScript, the Window object serves as the global object for all JS code contained in the browser window it represents.
Global Window object has a self referential property window property that can be used instead of this to refer to the global object.
The Window object defines the core global properties, but it also defines quite a few other globals that are specific to web browser and client side JS.
The Global object also holds the program-defined globals.

Immutable Primitive Values and Mutable Object References

Primitive values in JS are immutable: there is no way to change a primitive value.
Primitive values are always compared by value.

Objects are mutable: their values can be changed.

var obj = {x:1};

// Mutate the above object by changing its property’s value
obj.x = 7;

// Mutate it again by adding new property to it.
obj.y = 21;

Objects are compared by reference: two object values are same if and only if they refer to the same underlying object.
Objects are also called ‘reference type’ in JS, distinguishing them from primitive JS values.

var obj_1 = {a: 1};
var obj_2 = obj1;

//true, both obj_1 and obj_2, refer to same underlying object.
obj_1 === obj_2		

obj_3 = {a: 1};

//false, both obj_1 and obj_3, refer to different underlying objects though their values are same
obj_3 === obj_1;

obj1.a = 8;
obj2.a;		//8
obj3.a		//1

Type Conversions

JS is very flexible about the types of values it requires.
If JS expects a particular type of value, no matter what the supplied value is, JS will convert it to the type which is needed.



VALUE

STRING
NUMBER
BOOLEAN

Variable Scope

The scope of a variable is the region of program source code in which it is defined.
A global variable has the global scope: it is defined everywhere in the JS code.
Variables defined within a function are defined only within the body of the function, and known as local variable of that function.
If a Global variable and a local variable have the same name then inside the local scope, local variables hides the global variable.

var c=scope = “global”;		// a global variable
function checkScope() {
	var scope = “local”;		// a local variable with same name as global
	return scope;
}
checkScope();				// => “local”
